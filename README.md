# A Personal Birthday Gift Website  
**Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

## Project Overview  
This project is a special static website I created as a birthday gift for my best friend. Using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I designed a personalized page with images and videos, and deployed it for free on **Netlify**.  

To maintain privacy, Iâ€™ve replaced the original images with pictures of **Theo James**.

This repository is open to anyone who wants to explore, modify, or use it as a template for their own projects. Feel free to customize the content, design, or layout to suit your needs!
