A Personal Birthday Gift Website – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Project Overview
This project is a special static website I created as a birthday gift for my best friend. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed a personalized page with images and videos, and deployed it for free on Netlify. I’ve replaced the original images with pictures of Theo James to maintain privacy.
